# library-Management-System-Java-OOP-Project
Java OOP full project using GUI in frontend and Java in backend. 

This Library Management System is a Java-based application that allows users to manage books, check out books, and 
maintain membership details using an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach with a graphical user interface (GUI).

Checkout Process: Members can check out books and receive a receipt.
Membership Management: The system maintains a list of members who can check out books.
File Handling: Books and member details are stored in a text file for persistent storage

Technology Stack:-
Java: Main programming language.
Swing: For GUI development.
File I/O: For reading from and writing to text files.

Future Enhancements:-
Implement a more robust user input validation.
Enhance the UI with better styling and additional features (like searching for books).
Introduce a database to manage book and membership data for better scalability.
